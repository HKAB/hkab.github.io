I"€<p>I‚Äôve just finished Avatar the Last Airbender series (by just wannto know why this old series has rating so high, and now i know why). I don‚Äôt want to write any emotional reviews, but I found the technique the guru use to open chakras is quite interesting.</p>

<p>(I think) it is the combination of the meditation technique called <a href="#" class="tooltip-toggle" aria-label="In simple, you scan to feel every part of your body" tabindex="0">‚Äúscanning‚Äù</a> and some descent thoughts (I wouldn‚Äôt call this meditation because you have to think a lot). The whole idea (i think, again) is to appreciate and accept your past. It actually helps me bring up many memories that I‚Äôm not usually think of, the buried one. Anyway there are 7 things you should pay attention to, one by one:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Survival (Fear)</li>
  <li>Pleasure (Guilt)</li>
  <li>Willpower (Shame)</li>
  <li>Love (Grief)</li>
  <li>Truth (Lies)</li>
  <li>Insight (Illusion)</li>
  <li>Cosmic energy (Earth Attachment)</li>
</ol>

<p><em>I write all of this because I want to remember it, you - reader should watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH-HT9WCtiQ">original material</a></em></p>

<p>Look up in your memory, and let all the block elements clear. It‚Äôs going be a lot of distractions (at least for me), but you can use other technique called <a href="#" class="tooltip-toggle" aria-label="In simple, you come back to the focus objective after wandering around, no big deal" tabindex="0">‚Äúnoting‚Äù</a>‚Äù. After this, you should know yourself better :)</p>
