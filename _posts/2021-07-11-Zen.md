excerpt: Something that I learn through movies

I've just finished Avatar the Last Airbender series (by just want to know why this old series has rating so high, and now i know why). I don't want to write any emotional reviews, but I found the technique the guru use to open chakras is quite interesting. 

(I think) it is the combination of the meditation technique called <a href="#" class="tooltip-toggle" aria-label="In simple, you scan to feel every part of your body" tabindex="0">"scanning"[1]</a> and some descent thoughts (I wouldn't call this meditation because you have to think a lot, against <a href="#" class="tooltip-toggle" aria-label="You're supposed to watch the thoughts" tabindex="0">the idea of meditation</a>). The whole idea (i think, again) is to appreciate and accept your past. It actually helps me bring up many memories that I'm not usually think of, the buried one. Anyway there are <a href="#" class="tooltip-toggle" aria-label="Pool of energy (Emotional muck)" tabindex="0">7 things</a> you should pay attention to, one by one:
1. Survival (Fear)
2. Pleasure (Guilt)
3. Willpower (Shame)
4. Love (Grief)
5. Truth (Lies)
6. Insight (Illusion)
7. Cosmic energy (Earth Attachment)

_I write all of this because I want to remember it, you - reader should watch the [original material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH-HT9WCtiQ)_

Look up into your memory, and try to see all the block elements clearly. It's going be a lot of distractions (at least for me), but you can use other technique called <a href="#" class="tooltip-toggle" aria-label="In simple, you come back to the focus objective after wandering around" tabindex="0">"noting"[2]</a>. After this, you would be surprised by how much you've changed, and even the right path you should go to become a better "self".
