excerpt: Something that I learn through movies
---

Movies are always a great sources for learning something. Lately, I found the technique a characters uses to open chakras is quite interesting. Actually, it is even written on wikihow (with the title: How to Open Your Spiritual Chakras), but yeah, how can I even search for that thing.

_I write all of this because I want to remember it, you - reader should watch the [original material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH-HT9WCtiQ)_

(I think) it is the combination of the meditation technique called "scanning"[1] and the act of provoke descent thoughts (I wouldn't call this meditation because you have to think a lot, against the idea of meditation). The whole idea (i think, again) is to appreciate your past. It actually helps me bring up many memories that I'm not usually think of. Anyway there are 7 things you should pay attention to, one by one:
1. Survival (Fear)
2. Pleasure (Guilt)
3. Willpower (Shame)
4. Love (Grief)
5. Truth (Lies)
6. Insight (Illusion)
7. Cosmic energy (Earth Attachment)


Look up into your memory, and try to see all the block elements clearly. It's going be a lot of distractions (at least for me), but you could use other technique called "noting"[2]. After this, you would be surprised by how much you've changed, how much you've forgotten.
