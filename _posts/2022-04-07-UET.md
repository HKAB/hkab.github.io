title: On College
excerpt: things that i concluded after 4 years in college
---

It's been 4 years since I moved to Ha Noi for college. Changing the environment helps me alter my old self. Here are a few major, expensive lessons that I concluded after four years. Although some of it may seem obvious, but it took me time to realize. I'll keep it short so that it does not read like my diary ranting about college.

## 1. Try, there will be luck.

Opportunities come constantly. One should try even if one is not eligible. Keep in mind that luck is an important but hard to control factor.

## 2. Short-term, detailed plan do not work

Short-term, detailed plan is just a wasted of time. Instead, long term, simple plan work best.

## 3. Do, without thinking of the result.

This is the most unintuitive thing I learned throughout college. When you are given a task, there are two ways to complete it: by changing the process in order to match the result you expect, or by changing the process in order to get the best result. The difference is that one focuses on the result, and the other focuses on the process. In my experience, focusing on the result helps you stay on track, but focusing on the process helps you go far beyond what you expected.

## Ranting

- It takes me a while to realize that I do not love this job, what I love in general is a job where I can inject my creativity into.
- Appearance is important, but it's usually the last things I need and sometimes it's optional.
- As an introvert, my friend define my personality and habit.
- People have money know in advance what they should do and where they should go, therefore they have more chances to be successful.

## Regrets

Unfortunately, I haven't yet think of anything that I regrets during my college. This, in my opinion, is bad. No regrets means I'm utterly ignorant. You only have regrets if you aware of what you missed. 

## Memories
